I am a PhD student in the [quantum dynamics group](https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/keitel/evers/) of [JÃ¶rg Evers](https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/personalhomes/evers/) in the [theory division](https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/keitel/) lead by [Christoph H. Keitel](https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/keitel/HomepageCHK.html) at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg. I am interested in quantum optics and photonics both on the theoretical and on the experimental side.

In my current research, I mainly develop theoretical tools for open quantum systems with a special emphasis on the "high energy frontier" of quantum optics: the quest to use hard X-ray photons for studying novel quantum phenomena and, vice versa, to improve applications of X-rays by quantum optical methods.

In parallel, I also contribute to and perform experiments at large-scale X-ray facilities to establish X-ray quantum optics and nuclear cavity QED as a new platform.
