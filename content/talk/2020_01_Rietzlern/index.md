event: 41st EAS conference
event_url: "https://www.pks.mpg.de/~eas/#"

location: Rietzlern, Austria

summary: Invited conference talk at the 41st EAS conference
# abstract: "The concept of a few modes of the electromagnetic field interacting with matter is a paradigm inthe field of light-matter interactions. For example, the single mode Jaynes-Cummings model and itsmany generalisations, such as the many-body Dicke model, have been indispensable tools in studying open light-matter quantum dynamics. In particular in cavity and circuit  QED,  where  stronglight-matter coupling is routinely achieved in experiment, such models have been tremendously suc-cessful.  Recently, however, various experimental platforms have emerged where multi-mode effects,complex environments and the openness of the system constitute an essential part of the physics.Consequently, the applicability of few-mode models has been debated in these extreme regimes oflight-matter interaction. In this talk, I will present ”ab initio few-mode theory”,  which allows toinclude new physics into few-mode models without abandoning their conceptual and computationalsimplicity. I will outline practical implications for various fields featuring extreme light-matter in-teractions,  including  multi-mode  strong  coupling  and  ultra-strong  coupling  physics  as  well  as  theemerging platform of nuclear many-body cavity QED and X-ray quantum optics."
