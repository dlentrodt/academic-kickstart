When thinking of nuclei and quantum optics, the first topics that come to mind are nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and diamond vacancy centers. However, there is more!
Many nuclei feature ultra-narrow transitions in the hard X-ray domain, which can be excited by radioactive sources or modern X-ray facilities, such as X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs).
These systems provide a promising candidate for the new field of X-ray quantum optics. Compared to the alternative electronic resonances at these energies, nuclei in particular provide excellent coherence properties promising the access to truly quantum phenomena.

For example, Mössbauer nuclei feature incredibly low decoherence, with quality factors of 10<sup>12</sup> to 10<sup>24</sup>, often outcompeting even the best superconducting qubits that are nowadays used to build a quantum computer in this regard. This simple feature shows what an exciting platform these nuclei provide. Before you get your hopes up: we are not going to build a quantum computer with these nuclei any time soon. The main reason is that operating these extreme quantum systems is challenging.

A big part of my PhD research has been to see how far modern X-ray sources can take Mössbauer nuclei in the quantum direction. The big questions include:
- How do we drive the transitions efficiently?
- Which quantum dynamical processes can be induced?
- Can we achieve non-linear effects?
- How to detect quantum effects in the X-ray light and see quantum correlations?

One exciting platform to investigate these questions is nuclear cavity QED, where the interaction between X-rays and nuclei is enhanced by a thin-film material stack (see figure), which in effect behaves much like a Fabry-Perot cavity in the optical regime. One can achieve strong collective effects in this setup, which have already been investigated extensively (refs) in the semi-classical sector at low excitations. The idea here is that in addition to the astonishing development in X-ray source technology of the last decades, we will also require control techniques and tailored systems to make progress.

The main goal of answering the questions above is to see if we can achieve quantum effects, which would provide a completely new platform for quantum dynamics with extreme transitions. At the same time, quantum effects could be used to improve the many existing applications of these systems, ranging from materials science to metrology.
