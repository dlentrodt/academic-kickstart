abstract: Few-mode models are a cornerstone of the theoretical work in quantum optics, with the famous single-mode Jaynes-Cummings model being only the most prominent example. In this work, we develop an *ab initio* few-mode theory, a framework connecting few-mode system-bath models to *ab initio* methods. We first present a method to derive exact few-mode Hamiltonians for noninteracting quantum potential scattering problems and demonstrate how to rigorously reconstruct the scattering matrix from such few-mode Hamiltonians. We show that, upon inclusion of a background scattering contribution, an *ab initio* version of the well-known input-output formalism is equivalent to standard scattering theory. On the basis of these exact results for noninteracting systems, we construct an effective few-mode expansion scheme for interacting theories, which allows us to extract the relevant degrees of freedom from a continuum in an open quantum system. As a whole, our results demonstrate that few-mode as well as input-output models can be extended to a general class of problems and open up the associated toolbox to be applied to various platforms and extreme regimes. We outline differences of the *ab initio* results to standard model assumptions, which may lead to qualitatively different effects in certain regimes. The formalism is exemplified in various simple physical scenarios. In the process, we provide a proof of concept of the method, demonstrate important properties of the expansion scheme, and exemplify new features in extreme regimes.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Few-mode models boil down complex quantum dynamics to a few parameters. Our work expands such models to a full-fledged theory, allowing applications in more extreme regimes.
